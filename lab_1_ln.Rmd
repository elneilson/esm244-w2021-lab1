### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling & summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package.

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.
```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% # Can have many groupings: count(x,...)
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% # New name on left, old on right
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)
```
